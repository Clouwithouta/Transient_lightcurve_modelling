Getting the code
****************

You can download the code from the `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_ repository using

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git clone https://github.com/rraynaud/GRBs.git


In case you already have an account on `github.com <https://github.com/>`_ and uploaded a public SSH key on it, you could then rather use SSH:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git clone git@github.com:rraynaud/GRBs.git
